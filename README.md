# Servlet_Cookie
This is application about the use of Cookies and Session Tracking in Servlet.In this example, we are storing the name of the user in the cookie object and accessing it in another servlet. As we know well that session corresponds to the particular user. So if you access it from too many browsers with different values, you will get the different value.
